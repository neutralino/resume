---------------------------------------
WORK EXPERIENCE

* Graduate Researcher, Cornell University (2008 - 2013)

- Member of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider of the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.
- Worked in tight-knit teams on large-scale data analysis projects that successfully measured the production rate of rare particles and that searched for as-yet-undiscovered particles.
- Analysis responsibilities included the processing of datasets, the planning and optimization of the analysis strategy, the determination of selection efficiencies/systematic uncertainties, and the development of novel background-estimation methods.
- Developed a suite of data quality monitoring visualization software tools that provided real-time diagnostics on the performance of the detector trigger systems.


* Graduate Teaching Assistant, Cornell University (2007 - 2009)

- Conducted weekly tutorial and laboratory sessions, prepared quizzes, and graded homework and examinations in fundamental physics courses for engineers and pre-med majors.  Taught and supervised a total of roughly 60 students per semester.  


* Undergraduate Research Assistant, York University/University of Toronto (2006 - 2007)

- Implemented pattern-finding and distortion correction methods in C++ for calibrating beam images using a proton beam monitor system prototype and custom-made Monte Carlo simulations.
- Built a complete simulation model of the beam monitor system using proprietary ray-tracing software for studying the effects of system misalignment and beam size uncertainty on the final physics measurement.
