Research Experience

Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment
Ph.D. Student, Cornell University
August, 2008 - January, 2013

* Member of the CMS experiment at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.
* Developed a suite of data quality monitoring (DQM) visualization software tools for the detector trigger systems. The tools provide the DQM shift crew real-time diagnostics on the performance of the trigger systems and issue alarms when unexpected trigger rates are detected.
* Worked in tight-knit teams on large-scale data analysis projects for the measurement of the production rate of the top quark and the search for new-physics particles. Analysis responsibilities
included the processing and storing of the datasets, the optimization of the event selection strategy, the determination of efficiencies and systematic uncertainties, and the development of novel
background-estimation methods.


Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) Experiment
Undergraduate Research Project, University of Toronto
September, 2006 - May, 2007

* Integral member of the Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) proton beam monitor group.
* Built simulation model of OTR beam monitor system in ASAP ray-tracing software framework and studied effects of system misalignment and light efficiency on beam image.
* Evaluated impact of beam size uncertainty on final neutrino measurements using Monte Carlo simulations.

Summer Research Assistant, York University
May, 2006 - August, 2006

* Implemented pattern-finding and distortion correction methods for calibrating beam images using OTR system prototype and custom-made ray-tracing simulations.

Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) Experiment
Undergraduate Research Project, University of Toronto
January, 2006 - May, 2006

* Studied various systematic uncertainties on the measurement of the top quark mass using the Neutrino Weighting Algorithm method in the dilepton decay channel.

Quantum Optics Group
Summer Research Assistant, University of Toronto
May, 2004 - August, 2004

* Developed a Fabry-Perot interferometer for laser calibration.
* Repaired and improved functionality of laser diode modules using LabVIEW platform.

---------------------------------------
Teaching Experience

Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA
Teaching Assistant and Grader
Fall 2007-Spring 2009

* Conducted weekly tutorial and laboratory sessions, prepared quizzes, and graded homework and examinations in full-year fundamental physics courses for engineers and pre-med majors.  Taught and supervised a total of roughly 60 students per semester.  
* Graded for advanced graduate course in quantum field theory.
