WORK EXPERIENCE

* Graduate Research Scientist, Cornell University (08/2008 - 01/2013)

Member of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.  Developed a suite of data quality monitoring (DQM) visualization tools (written in C++ and Python) for the CMS detector trigger systems. The tools provide the DQM shift crew real-time diagnostics on the performance of the trigger systems and issue alarms when unexpected trigger rates are detected.  Worked in tight-knit teams on two large-scale data analysis projects in (a) the first measurement at CMS of the production rate of the top quark and (b) the search for new-physics particles.  Analysis responsibilities included the processing and storing of datasets, the optimization of the event selection strategy, the evaluation of efficiencies and systematic uncertainties, and the development of novel background-estimation methods.  


* Graduate Teaching Assistant, Cornell University (08/2007 - 05/2009)

Conducted weekly tutorial and laboratory sessions, prepared quizzes, and graded homework and examinations in fundamental physics courses for engineers and pre-med majors.  Taught and supervised a total of roughly 60 students per semester.  Graded for advanced graduate course in quantum field theory.


* Summer Research Assistant, York University (05/2006 - 08/2006)

Integral member of the proton beam monitor group for the Tokai-to-Kamioka neutrino physics experiment. Implemented pattern-finding and distortion correction methods for calibrating beam images using a beam monitor system prototype and with custom-made ray-tracing simulations.


* Summer Research Assistant, University of Toronto (05/2004-08/2004)

Developed a Fabry-Perot interferometer for laser calibration in the quantum optics physics group.  Repaired and improved functionality of laser diode modules.
